The "Distracted Driver Detection" project aims to enhance road safety by developing a computer vision system capable of identifying and classifying levels of driver distraction. This project involves the collection of a diverse dataset featuring instances of distracted driving behaviors, such as texting, talking on the phone, and adjusting in-car controls, which was taken from kaggle. Through meticulous data preprocessing and image processing techniques, relevant features are extracted from the collected images. The chosen machine learning or deep learning model, often leveraging Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), undergoes rigorous training using labeled data to recognize and classify distraction levels.
